## 📝 Lessons Learned

The "empty shell" MVP issue has been documented in `LESSON_LEARNED_DASHBOARD_FUNCTIONALITY.md` to prevent similar issues in future deployments. The key takeaways are:

1. Implement and test core functionality first
2. Test complete user flows, not just individual components
3. Verify frontend-backend integration
4. Include UI display verification in deployment checks

## 🔜 Next Steps

1. Obtain GitHub App private key file to complete GitHub automation
2. Resolve GoDaddy API rate limiting issues
3. Deploy to production platforms using the autonomous deployment system
4. Set up custom domain for the production deployment

The autonomous SaaS factory is now ready to generate and deploy micro-SaaS products with minimal human intervention.
